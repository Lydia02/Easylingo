                        English is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. It is the official language in 55 countries, which include primarily the USA, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. In 27 territories, English has the official status of the language used mainly for interactions with the government officials. This refers to Hong Kong, the Isle of Man, Puerto Rico, among many.

                        <h1>Peculiar Features</h1>
                        <p>The English alphabet consists of 26 letters and 40 distinct sounds. The 27th letter used to be ‘&’ and known as ampersand, but it was reduced within time and is used nowadays in the official speech to denote the part of the formal company or the collaboration of two writers/authors. There are 12 tenses in the English language, 3 of them are the main (past, present, future) and each of them in their turn is divided into 4 aspects (simple, progressive, perfect, perfect progressive). To use them correctly, you need much practice. The common sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object.

                            English spelling is not easy, as the language contains three-quarter words adopted from Latin, Greek, and French languages: mouse-mice, criterion-criteria, ox-oxen, etc. For the reason of influence of other languages, the words in English are pronounced in a different way than written or are written not the way they are pronounced: enough, beautiful, debt, sell-cell.</p>
